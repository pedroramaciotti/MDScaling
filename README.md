## MDScaling

Multi-dimensional network scaling for python.

A python module for the multi-dimensional scaling of networks. MDScaling takes topological data (a network of connected nodes) an produces a multi-dimensional embedding in a geometrical space where distance is related to topological similarity.

### Instalation

    pip install mdscaling

### Directed Bipartite Graphs

This is the module's main application. It allows for the embeddings/scaling of directed bipartite graphs, for a range of *methods*, a range of *parameters*, and the computation of comparison metrics for the *methods* x *parameters* space.

The input format is a CSV file with two columns and no header. Each line is an edge of the bipartite graph. Bipartite graphs have a set of *top* nodes an a set of *bottom* nodes. In the input file, the first columns contains the labels of the *bottom* nodes, and the second column contains the nodes of the *top* nodes.

For example, the first 5 lines of `dataset/twitter_france.csv` read

    B0,A591
    B1,A591
    B2,A591
    B3,A591
    B4,A591

defining 5 edges, connecting bottom nodes (Twitter followers) B0, B1, B2, B3, and B4 with top node A591 (a parliamentarian).

**Quick start** using datasets from the `dataset`folder as

    import mdscaling as mds
    DB = mds.DiBipartite('local_data/twitter_france.csv') # read the French MPs-followers bipartite graph
    DB.CA() # produce an embedding of top and bottom nodes with default values

Embedding coordinates of nodes are then available in the `DB.embedding` dataframe. The Correspondance Analysis embedding `CA` allows for specifying some parameters

    DB.CA(theta=3,dimensions=3,coordinates='top',all_nodes=False)

`coordinates` is the part of the bipartite used as original coordinates for the embedding procedure. `theta` is the threshold of `coordinate`-nodes-degree to select nodes for which to compute the embedding transformation. This transformation can be compute, nonetheless, to all nodes, by selection `all_nodes=True`. `dimensions` allows for specifying the number of dimensions of the embedding.

The following two figures show embeddings produced for the Chilean and French Twitter networks available in the `datasets`folder, using the script `tests/twitter_example.py`.
